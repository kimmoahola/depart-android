## Brief history of Depart

Depart started from the need of getting busses of Tampere, Finland to a map on my phone.
It was early 2012. Active development continued through 2012 as more cities and features got implemented.
After that Depart got a few bug fix releases as other jobs have taken most of my time.
On September 2015 Depart was open sourced here: https://github.com/termopetteri/depart-android/
